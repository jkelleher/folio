This application forms a key exercise for RAD301 (2015-16). It is a vehicle for relating many aspects of ASP.NET MVC including:

* Controllers
* Code First database generation
* Querying datasets for surfacing through Views
* Views incorporating CSS styling (via Bootstrap)
* Data Migration to facilitate changes to model
* Razor
* Passing data between Views
* Enhanced user interaction with jQuery

Each week is recorded in a separate branch of the [repo]({{site.repo}}). You should [checkout](https://asciinema.org/a/27865) the appropriate branch to see how the work is done - preferably after you have attempted the objectives yourself.
